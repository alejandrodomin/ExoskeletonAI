Any libs that get compiled by the project, third party or any needed 
in development. Prior to deployment, third party libraries get moved 
to /usr/local/lib where they belong, leaving the project clean 
enough to compile on our Linux deployment servers. I really use this 
to test different library versions than the standard.
